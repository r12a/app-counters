# app-counters
 Counters can be used for ordered lists, headings, figures, etc. This app allows you to see what is produced for a given number or sequence of numbers by the algorithms described by CSS3 Counter Styles and Predefined Counter Styles. You can select a defined style from a list, or paste in any counter-styles definition you may have invented.
